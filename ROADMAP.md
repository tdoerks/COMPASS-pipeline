# COMPASS Pipeline Roadmap

## Current Status (October 2025)
‚úÖ **Working:**
- Full end-to-end pipeline: Metadata ‚Üí SRA ‚Üí Assembly ‚Üí AMR + Phage Analysis
- AMRFinder for resistance gene detection
- VIBRANT for phage identification  
- DIAMOND for prophage database matching
- PHANOTATE for phage gene prediction
- Combined HTML report generation
- Parallelized execution (up to 30 concurrent downloads, 10 assemblies)

üîß **In Progress:**
- Testing on Kansas NARMS 2023 and 2025 datasets
- CheckV quality assessment (database path issues)

---

## Short-term Improvements

### 1. Fix Current Issues
- [ ] **CheckV database path** - Resolve container database location
- [ ] **PHANOTATE timeout** - Increase time limits or make optional
- [ ] **Entrez-direct Perl warnings** - Use newer container or suppress stderr
- [ ] **Error handling** - Allow pipeline to continue when individual samples fail

### 2. Enhanced Filtering
- [ ] Filter by **host** (human, chicken, cattle, swine)
- [ ] Filter by **isolation source** (clinical, food, environmental)
- [ ] Filter by **geography** (county-level, not just state)
- [ ] Filter by **collection date** (not just publication date)

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [x] Parallelize sample processing
- [ ] Optimize resource allocation per process
- [ ] Add checkpoint/restart capability
- [ ] Cache intermediate results more efficiently
